You are solving a 3x3 jigsaw puzzle. The puzzle pieces are currently scrambled. Your goal is to rearrange the pieces to recover the image. 

Available actions:
1. 'swap': Swap two pieces by specifying their coordinates. Format: `('swap', ((row1, col1), (row2, col2)))` where coordinates start from (0,0) at the top-left corner.
2. 'reorder': Reorder all pieces at once. Format: `('reorder', [0, 1, 2, ..., 8])` where the list represents the desired order of pieces from top-left to bottom-right.
3. 'stop': End the puzzle solving session. Format: `('stop', 'stop')`

Please respond with exactly one action and its arguments in the specified format. For example:
- To swap two pieces: `('swap', ((0, 0), (1, 1)))`
- To reorder all pieces: `('reorder', [0, 1, 2, ..., 8])`
- To stop: `('stop', 'stop')`

Index-to-cell mapping (0-based rows/cols):
- Index = row * 3 + col.
- Row 0 covers indices 0..2, row 1 covers 3..5, etc.
Example for 2x2: (0,0)->0, (0,1)->1, (1,0)->2, (1,1)->3.

This is step 1. You are allowed to take 99 more steps.
