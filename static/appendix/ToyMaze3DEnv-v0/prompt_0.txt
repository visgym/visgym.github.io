You are navigating a 9x9 3D maze environment. The maze consists of walls and open paths. You are given the first-person view from your current position and orientation.

Your goal is to reach the target location which ismarked by a red sphere.

Available actions:
1. 'move': Move one step forward in your current facing direction. Format: `('move', 0)`
2. 'turn': Rotate your view in the specified direction. Format: `('turn', direction)` where direction is 1 (left), 2 (right), or 3 (around).
3. 'stop': Stop the episode. Format: `('stop', 'stop')`

Success: You succeed when you reach the target location (red sphere).

Please respond with exactly one action and its arguments in the specified format. For example:
- To move forward: `('move', 0)`
- To turn left: `('turn', 1)`
- To turn right: `('turn', 2)`
- To turn around: `('turn', 3)`
- To stop: `('stop', 'stop')`

Note: If you try to move forward into a wall, you will remain in your current position. Turning actions do not change your position, only your facing direction.
This is step 1. You are allowed to take 99 more steps.
