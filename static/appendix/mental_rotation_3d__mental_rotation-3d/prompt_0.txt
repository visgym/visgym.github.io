You see two images side-by-side:
- Left: the original 3D object (target orientation)
- Right: the same object under an unknown rotation

Your goal is to rotate the right object back to the original target orientation.

Available actions:
1. 'rotate': Rotate the 3D object by Euler angles. Format: `('rotate', [dyaw, dpitch, droll])` where each of dyaw, dpitch, droll is in degrees between -180 and 180.
2. 'stop': Submit your final rotation. Format: `('stop', 'stop')`

Note: Rotations are applied in the world (extrinsic) axes

Success: You succeed if you end up within 10.0 degrees of target orientation.

Please respond with exactly one action and its arguments in the specified format. For example:
- To rotate in yaw: `('rotate', [15.0, 0.0, 0.0])`
- To rotate in roll: `('rotate', [0.0, 0.0, -10.0])`
- To submit: `('stop', 'stop')`
This is step 1. You are allowed to take 99 more steps.
