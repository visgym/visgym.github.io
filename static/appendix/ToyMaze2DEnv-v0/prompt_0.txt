You are navigating a 11x11 maze. The maze consists of walls (gray) and paths (white). You are represented by a blue circle, and your goal is to reach the red target square.

Available actions:
1. 'move': Move in one of four directions. Format: `('move', direction)` where direction is an integer:
   - 0=right, 1=up, 2=left, 3=down
2. 'stop': End the navigation session. Format: `('stop', 'stop')`

Success: You succeed if you reach the red target square.

Please respond with exactly one action and its arguments in the specified format. For example:
- To move right: `('move', 0)`
- To move up: `('move', 1)`
- To move left: `('move', 2)`
- To move down: `('move', 3)`
- To stop: `('stop', 'stop')`
This is step 1. You are allowed to take 99 more steps.
