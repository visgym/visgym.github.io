You are solving a 3D mental rotation task. Two panels are shown:
- Left: the target view of the object (identity orientation).
- Right: the current view that you can rotate.
Your job is to rotate the object on the right so it matches the left.

Available actions:
1. 'rotate': Apply an incremental Euler rotation (yaw, pitch, roll). Format: `('rotate', [d_roll, d_yaw, d_pitch])` with angles in degrees.
2. 'stop': Submit your final orientation. Format: `('stop', 'stop')`

Success: You succeed if the final rotation error is less than or equal to 5.0°.

Note: Rotations are applied in the world (extrinsic) axes

For example:
- Roll by 15°: `('rotate', [15, 0, 0])`
- To submit: `('stop', 'stop')`
This is step 1. You are allowed to take 99 more steps.
