You see an image of a broken matchstick equation.
Your goal is to fix the equation by moving ONE match per action.

Symbols (left->right) with indices:
[0:'0', 1:'-', 2:'7', 3:'3', 4:'/', 5:'3', 6:'=', 7:'9', 8:'9']

Available actions:
1. 'move': Remove one match from segment 'src_seg' of symbol at 'src_idx', then add it to segment 'dst_seg' of symbol at 'dst_idx'. Format: `('move', [src_idx, src_seg, dst_idx, dst_seg])` where:
   - src_idx, dst_idx ∈ [0, N−1], with src_idx ≠ dst_idx
   - src_seg, dst_seg ∈ matchstick_puzzles.TOTAL (e.g., {0..12})
   - The move must result in valid symbols at BOTH positions.
2. 'undo': Revert the last move (if any). Format: `('undo', 'undo')`
3. 'stop': Submit your current equation as final. Format: `('stop', 'stop')`

Success: The submitted equation must be mathematically correct (evaluated as lhs == rhs).

Segment legend (indices depend on symbol):
  0..6 : 7-seg digits (a,b,c,d,e,f,g), 6 is also the horizontal stroke used by '+'
  7    : plus vertical stroke (used by '+')
  8    : the multiply sign that goes from top left to bottom right
  9    : the multiply sign that goes from top right to bottom left
  11,12: equals upper/lower bars (used by '=')
A segment is valid for a symbol only if the resulting set of segments maps to a known glyph.

Please respond with exactly one action and its arguments in the specified format. For example:
- To move a match: `('move', [0, 6, 2, 0])`
- To undo: `('undo', 'undo')`
- To stop: `('stop', 'stop')`
This is step 1. You are allowed to take 99 more steps.
