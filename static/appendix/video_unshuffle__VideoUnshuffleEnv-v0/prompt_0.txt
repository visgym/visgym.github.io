You are given 5 video frames extracted from a short clip, laid out left->right in a shuffled order and labeled 1 through 5. The action being performed in the video is: 'pushing a chair with a hand'.

Your goal is to rearrange the frames so they appear in their original chronological order from left to right. Pay attention to the temporal progression of the action described above.

Available actions:
1. 'swap': Swap two frames by specifying their 1-based positions. Format: `('swap', (i, j))`
2. 'reorder': Provide the complete ordering in one shot. Format: `('reorder', [1, 2, ..., 5])` where the list gives the desired left-to-right arrangement.
3. 'stop': Finish and lock in the current ordering. Format: `('stop', 'stop')`

Please respond with exactly one action and its arguments in the specified format. For example:
- Swap the first and third frames: `('swap', (1, 3))`
- Reorder all frames: `('reorder', [2, 1, 4, 3, ..., 5])`
- Finalize the ordering: `('stop', 'stop')`
This is step 1. You are allowed to take 99 more steps.
